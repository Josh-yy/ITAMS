The IT asset management system can effectively replace the existing Google Sheets-based system and help the PHINMA - Education Network in managing, monitoring, and producing accurate data analysis reports for its IT assets. Additionally, the system will tag each asset with a QR code to effectively and easily update their hardware and software assets.
